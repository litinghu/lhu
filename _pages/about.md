I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/){:target="\_blank"} in 2016 under the supervision of Professor [Karsten Schwan](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Karsten.Schwan/){:target="\_blank"}. Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/){:target="\_blank"} in 2007. Currently, I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at FIUâ€™s School of Computing and Information Sciences.

During my Ph.D. studies, I have been fortunate to have opportunities to intern at different research labs and learn from many remarkable researchers. I spent the summer of 2015 at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center working with Shu Tao, Hui Kang and Michael V. Le. I spent the summer of 2013 at Intel Science & Technology Center for Cloud Computing, Carnegie Mellon University working with Michael Kozuch. I spent the summer of 2012 at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center working with Dilma Da Silva and Kyung Ryu. I spent the fall of 2011 at Microsoft Research Asia working with Zhenyu Guo. I spent the summer of 2010 at VMware working with Ajay Gulati.

My work has appeared in top systems venues like USENIX ATC, Middleware, IPDPS, ICDCS, HPDC, ICAC, Cluster, TPDS, SIGOPS. My research is gratefully supported by NSF, Department of Homeland Security, as well as a few more industry and university grants. I received the NSF CAREER Award in 2020 as sole-PI, the Cyber Flroida Seed Award in 2020 as lead-PI, and the NSF SPX grant in 2019 as lead-PI.
